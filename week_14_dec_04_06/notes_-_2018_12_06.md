# Notes for December 4, 2018

General Announcements:
* Reminder that the final lab is due Thursday night at 11:59pm. The last 3 problems (25,26 & 27) are optional. That material will not be on the final. 

* Project 2 Grading and Review:
    * The auto-grader will take your highest grade. If you feel your final grade is too low (not counting the style points) then let me know and I can review. Grades for the rest of Project 1 and Project 2 will hopefully be computed this week.
    * I looked at some of your code when you were working on Project 2, and sent messages through Moodle. I wasn't able to address everyone, and focused on people actively working on it. Please email me if you want feedback as you work on getting a higher grade in the Practice Section.

* Late submission in the Practice Section:
    * Compare your grade on Canvas before working. As mentioned, your highest grade is taken.
    * If you want a grade boost on late submissions, keep track of all the labs/quizzes/projects you work on and send me a single email of everything you worked on. You have up to Wednesday morning before the final to complete it.
    * Reminder - Your grade boost will be the average of your original grade and the new auto-grade. No style grade boost, that is set.

* Final
    * Barely starting to take shape. Like the first test, it will be 75% mutiple choice and 25% written. Though it will obviously be harder than the final. No notes allowed. 
    * Points will be a roughly 50-50 split between Python and MATLAB
    * Python will only be on the multiple choice
    * For Python, focus on the first exam, and Exam 2 short answer (#1-15). I'll cover additional Thursday.
    * For MATLAB, the written will be similar to lab questions
    * More coverage Thursday

* Thursday
    * I'll cover try/except, explain why I don't like the usage I've seen so far, and show how to do it better (5-10 minutes, not on final)
    * I'll provide some next-step resources for anyone who wants to continue programming (5ish minutes)
    * There will be more MATLAB iClicker examples, and I will cover my favorite Python multiple choice examples
    * We'll go through any important MATLAB stuff that we do not get to today
    * I'll cover any MATLAB issues that come up between today and Thursday, and answer any questions
    * I'll go through what I consider to be the most important Python concepts
    * Will address any other questions

* Today's Agenda:
    * Two iClicker questions, review these for the final
    * Finish going through Professor Wassil's slides, starting with Ch. 2 & 5 PDF slide 15
