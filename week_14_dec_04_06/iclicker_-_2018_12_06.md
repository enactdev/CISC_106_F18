## Given:
```
bill_amount = input("Enter the total bill: ")
my_half = bill_amount / 2
print(round(my_half, 2))
```

## 1) You're splitting a restaurant bill with a friend, so you wrote a quick Python script to figure out your share, but it is not quite working. You want to accept any amount, including cents, and round it to two decimal places. What line should you fix above?
#### A) my_half = float(bill_amount / 2)
#### B) print(round(float(my_half), 2))
#### C) my_half = float(bill_amount) / 2
#### D) bill_amount = float("Enter the total bill: ")
#### E) print(round(float(my_half)))

## Given:
```
def my_double(an_int):
       print("You passed:",  an_int)
       2 * an_int
       
my_int = 7
n = my_double(my_int)
```
### 2) What is the value of ```n```
#### A) 14
#### B) 7
#### C) None
#### D) "You passed: 7"
#### E) An empty string

### 3) How would you import the math library and then instantiate a variable ```pi_floor``` with the floor of pi?
```
# A) 
import math
pi_floor = math.floor(pi)

# B) 
import math
pi_floor = math.floor(math.pi)

# C) 
import math
pi_floor = floor(pi)

# D) 
import math
pi_floor = floor(math.pi)
```

## Given:
```
a = 5
b = 10
```

## 4) Given the above values for a and b, which of the following will produce an error?
* A) my_div = a // b
* B) my_diff = b - a
* C) my_sum = a b
* D) print(a, b, a / b, b / a)
* E) x = b > a

## Given:
```
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 2
```

## 5) How many times is the line ```while i < 10:``` evaluated? (In other words, how many times is that test performed)
* A) 5 times
* B) 6 times
* C) 7 times
* D) 10 times
* E) 11 times

## 6) Add parenthesis to ```7 * 6 * 2 + 8 // 3``` while maintining precedence
* A) (7 \* 6) \* (2 + (8 // 3))
* B) (7 \* (6 \* 2)) + (8 // 3)
* C) ((7 \* 6) \* 2) + (8 // 3)
* D) (7 \* (6 \* (2 + 8))) // 3

## Given:
```
a = bool(str('0'))
b = bool(int('0'))

print(a, b)
```

## 7)  What is printed above?
* A) True True
* B) True False
* C) False True
* D) False False

---

---

## Given:
```
def my_calculation(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a * b
    elif a < b:
        return a + b
    else:
        return 1
```

## 8) What is printed by the statement ```print(my_calculation(my_calculation(2, 3), 7))```
* A) 30
* B) 10
* C) 11
* D) 12
* E) An error message

---

## 9) If you need to know what the range() function does, what command will you use:
* A) docstring(range)
* B) help(range())
* C) from help import range
* D) help(range)
* E) # Docstring range

### MATLAB similar: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

**Note on 5, also be able to answer if I asked how many times line `i = i + 2` was run.**

Answers: 1) C, 2) C, 3) B, 4) C, 5) B, 6) C, 7) B, 8) D, 9) D
