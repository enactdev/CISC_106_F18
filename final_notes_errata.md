## Final notes:
* I'm sorry not all project grades are posted yet. There will be time after they are posted for you to contest any grades. I will send a Canvas announcement later today with details.
* If you need to use the bathroom, raise your hand and show that you're leaving your cell phone on your desk.

## Final errata:

### #15: This is using i for item instead of index, my mistake there. *But* there is still a correct answer in the list.
