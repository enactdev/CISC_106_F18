Functions are finished when a ```return``` statement is executed. Full stop.


Also, warning, the mini-projects are harder than the labs, and fewer of you will get 100% on them. The labs are set up to let you work through things until you get 100%, and most students get 100. The mini-projects will have a larger grade distribution. 

The first mini-project requires you to write several functions, and then combine them together as a single program.
