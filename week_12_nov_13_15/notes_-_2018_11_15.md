# Notes for November 15, 2018

General Announcements:
* Some students are using try/except in their projects, specificially in the `is_float()` function. The instructors have not taught this, though some TA's have recommended it. You will get full credit using it for the functions due yesterday, but you will have to write it without try/except for the final submission. 
* Thoughts after meeting with students on Tuesday:
    * Wny I think the weighting was fair: Yes it gave some students who had a lower unweighted score a higher weighted score than others, but it rewarded people who were consistent. Students who jumped the most were able to answer questions amoung all the different sections, but bombed one question from each.
    * But, I acknowledge that students would have approached the test differently knowing how it would be weighted. I swear, I didn't know how it would be weighted either, but I understand the point.
    * It was also pointed out that at the beginning of the semester I said students who did increasingly better each test would end up doing well, and with this second test basically no one was able to do better. Good point. I don't have a resolution yet, and might not end up with one, but I'm thinking it through.
* Today's Agenda:
    * iClicker survey
    * Quick review on functions and while loops
    * Using Octave in notebooks if you are on Anaconda
    * Quick overview of Matplot lib and how to use it in a notebook
    * Matlab vs. Python cheatsheet
    * Let's write some Matlab code

## Quick review on functions and while loops

Functions are done when they hit a return statement. Thus, within a function, it is ok to setup what would otherwise be an infinte loop. (You could also do this outside of a function with a `break` statement instead of a `return` statement, but I don't.)

```
def get_something_anything():
    while True:
        user_input = input('Type something. Litereally, just type anything: ')
        if user_input != '':
            return user_input
```

## Using Octave in notebooks if you are on Anaconda

You can [install this to Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/octave_kernel) to run Octave
