# Grade Scenarios

## First -- Where the class currently stands

### Average of both exams:

90-100: 12
80-89: 11
70-79: 9
60-69: 5
50-59: 5
40-49: 3
0-39: 1


**First, to recap, you can boost the lower of your two exam grades if it is lower than your final exam grade. Your regular exam score will be replaced with the average of the original score and your final exam score.**

## Example:

### Original scores
* Exam 1: 80
* Exam 2: 60
* Final Exam: 90
* Exam Average: 76.7

### Replacement scores
* Exam 1: 80
* Exam 2: 75 ((60 + 90) / 2)
* Final Exam: 90
* Exam Average: 81.7

**However, note that your quiz average is factored in with your exam grades *before* the ten point limit of averaging labs, projects, and attendance. From the sylabus: *Your final numerical grade cannot be more than 10 points higher than your exam+quiz average* **

### The "quiz" part can help.

**The three exams make up 45% of your final grade, and the quizes are 5%. So, for that half of your final grade, the exams are weighted 90% and the quizes 10%. **

## Example

**If your exam average is a 70 and your quiz average is a 100, then combined they are: `(70 * .9) + 10 == 73`.**

**That's the difference between a C- and a C, and in this scenario a student can get a B if their lab/projects/attendance is high enough.**

**Based on the math, if your exam average is higher than the quizzes help you less, and if your exam average is lower they help you more.**
