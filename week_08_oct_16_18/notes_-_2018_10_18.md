# Notes for October 18, 2018

General Announcements:
* Lab 5 is broken into two parts, so that you are not overwhelmed while working on the project.
    * The first part will be open tomorrow and covers lists.
    * Second part on strings
* Next test two weeks from Thursday
* Next week will be the last week of new material
    * We will cover classes and objects, but not as in depth as I would like
    * We will cover the Python Matplotlib library. I added a link to next week's readings
    * Next week we will also do more with 2-d lists (lists within a list). You will also do this in MatLab
* We will continue to cover some Python after the second test, and you will be working on the second project.
* Third and final project will be in MatLab, and will be a continuation of the second project. 
* I have a few tests that still need to be returned. See me after class if you haven't picked it up yet.
