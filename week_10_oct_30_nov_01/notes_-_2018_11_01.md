# Notes for November 1, 2018

General Announcements:
* No iClicker questions today, attendance will not be taken. 
* Tomorrow you start the second project. For the first part of the second project, you have two functions due next week. I will make them due Friday at 6:30pm so you have time after the test to finish. Once again, there will be some optional functions that I highly suggest you write, especially the `is_float()` function. 
* As a bonus, there will be 12 points of extra credit available, 3 points each for writing each of the four optional functions. However, your total project grade can not be over 300 (3 projects worth 100 points each). 
* My GitHub notebooks are not rendering right now. I think the issue is on GitHub's side because I have not updated them. However, I am still looking into it and will follow up after class. For now you can view on Binder. There is a link on the GitHub repository home page, and I added links to Canvas as well.

* Today's Agenda:
    * Quick demo of using the Binder scratchpad through GitHub
    * Review `min()` function for the project
    * Topic Review from Professor Wassil
    * Go through Tuesday's notebook
    * Practice test 2 -- Written
