# Observations I made while grading

* A lot of students did not cast the lines from the file as an integer. Remember that input is a string, whether you use the `input()` function or read from a file. This will be tested on the final.
* For the `remove_max()` problem, a lot of you deleted from the list you were iterating through. That *can* work sometimes, but will not always work.
